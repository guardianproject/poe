  s.description      = <<-DESC
This pod contains all the stuff needed to enable a unified onboarding and connecting experience for
official Tor enabled open source apps.

It contains scenes to explain Tor a little, scenes to set up Tor bridges and a connecting scene,
which rotates nice images together with claims about how Tor can help your users.

This pod is prominently used in the OnionBrowser: https://github.com/mtigas/OnionBrowser

Written in Swift 4.2.
